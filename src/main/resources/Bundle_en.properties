welcomeText=Welcome to the Memory Maze
titleInfo=This game tests your memory skills by challenging you to remember the locations of various cubes on the screen.
stepText=Here's a step-by-step guide to get started:
stepOne=When you open the game, you will be taken to the main menu. Here, you have two options: Option A) to register or login. If you're a new user, click on the "register" button and choose a username and a password to create a new account. If you've already registered, enter your username and password to log in. Option B) you can play without register or login
stepTwo=Once you've logged in, you will see three different levels of the game: easy, medium, and hard. The easy game has 6 cubes, the medium game has 12, and the hard game has 20. Choose the level you want to play.
stepThree=When you start the game, you will see a grid of cubes. Each cube has a hidden image on it. Your goal is to remember the location of each image and match them with their corresponding pair. To flip a cube and reveal the image, click on it with your mouse.
stepFour=Once you've revealed two cubes with matching images, you will not be able to select them any more and you will earn points. If you reveal two cubes with different images, they will flip back over and you will lose a point. Try to match all the pairs in as few moves as possible to earn a high score.
stepFive=After you finish the game, the game will automatically save your score if you are logged in. You can also view the world scores to see how you compare to other players around the world.
stepSix=In addition, you can view your own stats in a chart to track your progress over time. This chart will show you how many games you've played, your average score, and your best score for each level.
lastLine=That's it! Have fun playing the Memory Game and improving your memory skills.
